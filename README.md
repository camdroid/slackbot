# slackbot
Just playing around with Slack integrations

Based off the tutorial here: https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html

And here: https://realpython.com/blog/python/getting-started-with-the-slack-api-using-python-and-flask/

Right now, this is only working locally - to actually run this, run './ngrok http 5000', and paste the https link into the URL field in the Slack integration. Eventually I'll get this running on AWS so I don't have to do that aymore. /shrug
